**Regex (regular expressions)**

notation for tokens

simple operations with regex
| regex | set represented by regex |
| a | {a} single symbol|
| ab | {ab} concat of two regex |
| a|b | {a,b} union of two regex|
| a\* | {E, a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, ...} repetition of a regex (includes null) |
| [a-z] | {a,b,c,d} shorthand for union} |

**How does Regex recognize comma?**

- order of operation matters when using Regex (putting : before :- in regex will)
- put backslash in front of period, question mark parentheses to search for those tokens specifically
- Can search for keywords

- identifier - letter followed by zero or more letters or digits
  - letter (letter | digit)\*
  - To do all letters [A-z]
    - have to start with capitals
    - includes items between capitals and lowercase in ASCII
  - [a-zA-z]([a-zA-z]|[0-9])\*
- Look for string tokens before identifiers
  - starts with quotations, characters in between, ends with quotes
  - regex for string
    - '[^']\*'
    - looks for quote, then anything in between that isn't a quote, and then close quote
