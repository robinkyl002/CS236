# Derivation and Parsing Trees

- Recursive Grammars always have infinite strings in the derivation

## Parse Tree

- Root -> start
- leaves -> terminal
- interior nodes -> non terminal
- production applications -> shown by lines between nodes
- Nodes cannot have more than one grammar symbol

### Top-down Parse

- start at root non terminal, choose production to rewrite nonterminal
- Stop when no nonterminals remain
- simpler to implement
- We will use predictive parser

### Bottom-up Parse

- Begin with input string
- at each step, reduce substring to non-terminal
- stop when only start nonterminal remains
- can handle more grammars
