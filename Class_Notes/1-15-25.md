# Grammars

## Lab/project Notes

- write code that implements FSM for each token type
- Allow apostrophes to be used for strings
- use isalpha(), isspace(), is
- implement function to ignore whitespace between characters of function
- Can run each FSM for a item, then see which one matches the most of the input
- use switch case for determining which FSM to use
- Only worry about line comments, not block comments

## Grammars

- tokens sent from scanner to parser
- parser checks to see if syntax is correct
  - Whether things are in the right order, valid names
- Grammar made up of rules
  - Replacement rule
  - E -> (E + E)
  - E -> (E \* E)
  - E -> 1
  - E - > x
  - E -> y
- Generate (x \* (1 + y))
- E -> E _ E - > x _ E -> x _ (E + E) -> x _ (1 + E) -> x \* (1 + y)
  - process called derivation
- Terminology
  - Production (rule) - What things can be replaced by what
  - Terminal - only final state
  - Non-terminal (left side of arrow) - cannot be final state - can replace other things
  - Start symbol - first symbol to be used
- Form of valid production (rule)
  - nonterminal(head) -> non terminal or terminal
