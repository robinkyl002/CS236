# Parse Trees and Ambiguous Grammar

Scanner should return vector or array of tokens

## Ambiguous Grammar

- With a grammar, you can produce a certain string through more than one path
- Ambiguous grammar, when shown through parse trees, shows that order of operations varies, therefore results vary
- Operator precedence - order of operations
- Order associativity - left to right
- Lowest precedence close to root, highest precedence close to leaf nodes
- Parentheses need to be higher precedence, but must be able to surround an expression
- Ambiguous case is example of grammar where there is more than one parse tree to reach an expression
- E -> E + T -- E -> T + E
  - Switches from left to right associativity
